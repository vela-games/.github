We are Vela Games, an independent game studio in Dublin, Ireland :ireland: , developing a new genre experience we’re calling multiplayer online co-operative [or MOCO short]! 

Our first game is code-named Project-V, and is currently in pre-production. The game takes inspiration from both MOBAs and MMOs, blending skilled teamplay with adventure and adaptation.  At its core, Project-V is a PVE co-op multiplayer game that can be played competitively.

We haven't widely revealed the game yet, and still have a ways to go, but there are many ways for you to get involved! 

[JOIN OUR DISCORD COMMUNITY](https://discord.gg/yxcgv3Y8yS) to discover sneak-peeks, updates and information, and fun Project-V events! 

[PLAYTESTERS WANTED!](https://vela.games) Sign-up online to be a a part of some early pre-alpha tests that will be happening next year!

[HELP US MAKE PROJECT-V!](https://vela.games/careers/) We’re always looking for awesome team members  to work at Vela to bring Project-V to life.
