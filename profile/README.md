We are Vela Games, an independent game studio in Dublin, Ireland :ireland:, at Vela we're developing Evercore Heroes, a brand new competitive PVE experience. 

In Evercore Heroes Four teams of four heroes from a diverse and powerful roster will compete to be the first to take down an epic boss. Choose your team composition, master your Hero’s unique skills, & battle to victory! The game takes inspiration from both MOBAs and MMOs, blending skilled teamplay with adventure and adaptation.  At its core, Evercore Heroes is a PvE  game that can be played competitively.
